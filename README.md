Introduction:
Simon Game is a game that has been around for many years.  This is my first project as a student of General Assembly Software Engineering.

Technologies used:
HTML 
CSS 
Javascript

Installation Instructions: 
If you want to play with the code you can clone the repository into a local file.

If you want to play the game just go to:
https://nitimson.github.io/Simon-Game/

User Story:

    Player starts the game.
    This prompts the computer to make a single choice between red, green, blue, and yellow that will light up. 
    The player now has to remember that color and choose it in the correct sequence.
    The computer goes again but this time chooses two colors.
    The player has to, again, choose those same to colors in the correct sequence.
    This iteration continues until the player gets the color sequence wrong or quits the game by refreshing the page.

After playing the game, the reset button was removed and window reloads when player gets a wrong choice.
