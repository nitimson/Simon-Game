User Story:
    Player starts the game.
    This prompts the computer to make a single choice between red, green, blue, and yellow. The user will clearly see what choice the computer made by seeing the color get brighter.
    The player now has to remember that color and choose it again.  
    The computer goes again but this time chooses two colors.
    The player has to then choose those same to colors in the order in which the computer did.
    This iteration continues until the player gets the color sequence wrong or quits the game.
